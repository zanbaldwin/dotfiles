# :book: Yet Another Dotfiles Repo

To setup a new environment:

```bash
cd ~
git clone "git@github.com:zanbaldwin/dotfiles.git" "~/.dotfiles"
```

Follow the installation steps in [`install-fedora.md`](install-fedora.md); if not using Silverblue, ignore all `toolbox` container manager commands.
If not using Fedora, then read through the toolbox scripts and figure this shit out yourself.

The old, archived, _unmaintained_ [Debian-based setup script](archive/install-ubuntu.sh) from when I used Ubuntu is still around.

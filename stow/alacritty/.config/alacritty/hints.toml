# Keys used for the hint labels.

# List with all available hints
#
# Each hint must have any of `regex` or `hyperlinks` field and either an
# `action` or a `command` field. The fields `mouse`, `binding` and
# `post_processing` are optional.
#
# The `hyperlinks` option will cause OSC 8 escape sequence hyperlinks to be
# highlighted.
#
# The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
# `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
#
# The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
# the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
#
# If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
# shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
# (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs and applies only to
# `regex` matches.
#
# Values for `action`:
#   - Copy (Copy the hint's text to the clipboard)
#   - Paste (Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search)
#   - Select (Select the hint's text)
#   - MoveViModeCursor (Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint)
enabled = []

# Example

# [[hints.enabled]]
# regex = "(ipfs:|ipns:|magnet:|mailto:|gemini:|gopher:|https:|http:|news:|file:|git:|ssh:|ftp:)[^\u0000-\u001F\u007F-\u009F<>\"\\s{-}\\^⟨⟩`]+"
# hyperlinks = true
# command = "xdg-open"
# post_processing = true
# mouse = { enabled = true, mods = "None" }
# binding = { key = "U", mods = "Control|Shift" }

# FYI: Alacritty will make links clickable by default, but Zellij doesn't
# pass through mouse hover/clicks to Alacritty unless the Shift key is
# pressed.

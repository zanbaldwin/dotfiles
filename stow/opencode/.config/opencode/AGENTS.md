# Documentation for Agents

Please see `AGENTS.md` in the project's root directory for the main project documentation and guidance.
For detailed module-specific implementation guides, also check for `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories throughout the project.
These component-specific `AGENTS.md` files contain targeted guidance for working with those particular areas of the codebase.

## Updating AGENTS.md Files

When you discover new information that would be helpful for future development work, please:

- **Update existing `AGENTS.md` files** when you learn implementation details, debugging insights, or architectural patterns specific to that component
- **Create new `AGENTS.md` files** in relevant directories when working with areas that don't yet have documentation
- **Add valuable insights** such as common pitfalls, debugging techniques, dependency relationships, or implementation patterns

This helps build a comprehensive knowledge base for the codebase over time.
